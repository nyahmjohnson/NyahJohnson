    <title>Nyah's time at the Oakland Mayor's Office</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Welcome to the Oakland Mayor's Office</p>
    <p>This intership was unpaid and was soley voulnteer and learning based. Each intern was assigned to a specfic area based on their interest. In addition, there was a weekly intern huddle where we would prep for things like City Council meetings or get to know each other.</p>

    <li>While at he Mayor's Office I worked with TRiO (Teachers rooted in Oakaland)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Teachers Rooted in Oakland is an innovative, scalable project that addresses the intersection of multiple major crises: housing unaffordability, recruitment and retention of teachers of color, educational inequity, and chronic stress for educators working with vulnerable children. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I enjoyed working for the Mayor's Office and Teachers Rooted in Oakland. I vouluntereed at MLK day where I cleaned up around East Oakland and at the Cole Warehouse. I was given the opportunity to network with the Mayor and other great people. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to work in lower levels of Government!</p>
