</head>
<body>
    <p>Welcome to Okta!!</p>
    <p>Okta is a Okta, Inc. is a San Francisco-based publicly listed identity and access management company. It offers cloud software that assists businesses in managing and securing user authentication into applications, as well as allowing developers to implement identity controls into applications, websites, online services, and devices.</p>
    <p>At Okta I work in the Customer Experience Center (CEC) which is under the Strategic Events Team. </p>
    <p>My Tasks at my Okta Internship include:</p>

    <li>Making Welcome decks and CEC Emails</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Welcome decks are presented during each briefing. A Briefing is when the account team and campaign managers picth Okta to other companies. Each Welcome deck has key information about the briefing such as the members from the company that will be attending, the agenda and the okta discussion leaders. With every welcome deck a cec email also has to be made. The CEC email has information such as contact info for the campaign owner, linkedin links for all discussion leaders and a link to order complemenatry gifts and snacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Sending out Gift and Snack Orders</li>
    <ul>
        <li>When responses come in through the survey linked in the cec emails, I will send out gift and snack orders through a application called Almaden which is a company that partnerd with Okta. </li>
    </ul>

    <li>Create Campaigns before briefings and Update Campaings once breifings are over </li>
    <ul>
        <li>When a briefing request comes in I am tagged in a spreadsheet and expected to use typeform to create a Salesforce campaign. After the Briefing has finished, I am tagged again which means I need to add the company members who attended and the breifing notes to the same Salesforce campaing I created.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Find Venues for out of Office events</li>
    <ul>
<li>The strategic events encompasses executive dinners, city tours, and other events. These events need venues, caters, furniture, keynote speakers and entertainment. The research for these things fall to me. </li>
    </ul>

    <li>Go to zoom meetings and take notes for my supervisor</li>
    <ul>
        <li>My supervisor is very busy. She cannot make all of the meetings on her calendar. When she cannot make a meeting I will attend for her, take notes and send them to her.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have been at this internship since August 30th, 2021. This intership has taught me so much about professionalism and the many parts of a business. Although it has been hard juggling my school work and this Internship, I don't regret joing the Oktanauts!!</p>
