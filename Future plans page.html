<body>
    <p>After High School Plans!!</p>

    <p>I will be continuing my academic journey at UC Berkerley in the College of Letters and Science</p>
    <li>I am hoping to major in Interdisciplinary studies with a focus on:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Rhetoric -- specifically how speech is used in law and politics</li>
        <li>Legal Studies</li>
        <li>Ethnic Studies</li>
        <li>Contemporary Literature</li>

    </ul>

    <li>If I have time I am hoping to get a minor in:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Civil Rights Interdisciplinary</li>
        <li>Logic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am planning of taking advantage of my education at Berkely to fully prepare me to thrive in law school and as a Civil Rights Attorney. I also plan on joining debate and Mock Trials. If I have time I would like to study abroad and join a sorority.</p>
